Why do we use a Pull Request workflow?
PRs are a great way of sharing information, and can help us be aware of the changes that are occuring in our codebase. They are also an excellent way of getting peer review on the work that we do, without the cost of working in direct pairs.

Ultimately though, the primary reason we use PRs is to encourage quality in the commits that are made to our code repositories

Done well, the commits (and their attached messages) contained within tell a story to people examining the code at a later date. If we are not careful to ensure the quality of these commits, we silently lose this ability.

Poor quality code can be refactored. A terrible commit lasts forever.

What constitutes a good PR?
A good quality PR will have the following characteristics:

It will be a complete piece of work that adds value in some way.
It will have a title that reflects the work within, and a summary that helps to understand the context of the change.
There will be well written commit messages, with well crafted commits that tell the story of the development of this work.
Ideally it will be small and easy to understand. Single commit PRs are usually easy to submit, review, and merge.
The code contained within will meet the best practises set by the team wherever possible.
